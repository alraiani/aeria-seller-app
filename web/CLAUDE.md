# AERai Seller Web (seller.aeraigroup.com)

Multi-user web app for AERai Group's Amazon seller operations: source files (Amazon SP-API reports) land untouched in blob storage, are parsed into a staging layer in a centralized SQL Server database, promotes it into curated tables, and exposes reporting views to Razor Pages (dashboard, inventory, orders, settlements, products/COGS, import tools, user admin).

**Always load the `web-coding-standards` skill before writing or reviewing code here.** It holds the principles, patterns, practices, and commenting standard this solution follows.

The WPF desktop app in `../src` is a **reference only** for domain concepts. This solution never references it, never builds it, and does not inherit its SQLite workarounds (`DateTimeOffset` translates fine on SQL Server). Rules in the root `CLAUDE.md` about WPF, WPF-UI, MVVM, DPAPI, and SQLite do not apply here.

## Solution layout

```
web/
  AERai.Web.slnx
  src/
    AERai.Web.Domain/          # Entities: Staging/ (raw), Core/ (curated), Reporting/ (view read models). No references.
    AERai.Web.Application/     # Abstractions, use-case services, DTOs, Result, file parsing. References Domain.
    AERai.Web.Infrastructure/  # AppDbContext, EF configs, migrations (incl. views/procs), queries, Identity adapters.
    AERai.Web.UI/              # Razor Pages + Program.cs composition root.
  tests/                       # xUnit: Application.Tests (pure), Infrastructure.Tests (needs SQL; skips without AERAI_TEST_SQL)
  infra/                       # Bicep for Azure (App Service, Azure SQL, Key Vault, App Insights, custom domain)
  samples/                     # Example import files
  docker-compose.yml           # Local SQL Server 2025 (+ optional containerized app)
```

Dependencies: `UI → Application → Domain`; `Infrastructure → Application`. `UI` references `Infrastructure` **only** from `Program.cs` (`AddInfrastructure`, `InitializeDatabaseAsync`). PageModels never touch `AppDbContext`, `UserManager`, or `SignInManager` — they call Application interfaces (`IIdentityService`, `IReportingQueries`, …).

## Data flow: source → blob → staging → core → views

```
Amazon SP-API reports ─┐  (upload today; automated download later)
                       ▼
   Blob storage  raw/{source}/{yyyy}/{MM}/{dd}/{id}-{file}   ← landing zone, write-once, kept forever
                       │  StagingImportService.StageRawFileAsync (always reads FROM blob)
                       ▼
   stg.*   raw text rows ── core.usp_PromoteImportBatch ──► core.*  typed ──► rpt.vw_*  views ──► pages
```

- **Landing zone** (`IRawFileStore`, Azure Blob Storage; Azurite locally): every accepted file is stored byte-for-byte before parsing, with its SHA-256 recorded on `stg.ImportBatch` (`RawFilePath`, `RawFileSha256`). Blobs are never overwritten.
- **Staging reads from the blob, never from the upload stream**, so uploads, re-staging (`RestageAsync`), and future machine ingestion all share one path. A future SP-API worker should: download report → `IRawFileStore.SaveAsync` (path from `RawFilePaths.Build`) → `StageRawFileAsync`.
- Files that fail parsing stay in the landing zone (audit) but create no batch.
- Path layout is an Application concern (`RawFilePaths`); the store itself never interprets content.

## Amazon SP-API ingestion (scheduled pulls)

- **Schedules are data, managed in the app** (Tools → Amazon sync, Operator role): `ops.SyncSchedule` rows with interval (min 15 min) or daily-at-local-time + IANA time zone, lookback, auto-promote, enabled. Next-run math is `ScheduleCalculator` (DST-safe, unit-tested). Default schedules are seeded **disabled**.
- **Worker**: `SyncSchedulerWorker` (hosted service) runs due schedules and "Run now" requests sequentially. Due slots are claimed with a compare-and-swap on `NextRunAt`, so multiple instances never double-run. History is `ops.SyncRun`; `ops.IngestedReport` guarantees an Amazon report is ingested once.
- **Flow**: `ReportIngestionService` → `IAmazonReportsGateway` (request → poll → download, or list for settlements) → `IRawFileStore.SaveAsync` → `StageRawFileAsync` → optional `PromoteAsync`. Same path as uploads from the blob onward.
- **All SP-API HTTP goes through `SpApiPipelineHandler`** (LWA token via `LwaTokenProvider`, per-operation token buckets in `SpApiRateLimiter`, retry/backoff on 429/5xx, one refresh on 401/403, structured logging without secrets). Never create another `HttpClient` that calls `sellingpartnerapi-*.amazon.com`. Report documents are downloaded with a separate client that never sends the access token (pre-signed S3 URLs).
- **Modes** (`SpApi:Mode`): `Disabled` (default), `Simulated` (Development: `SimulatedReportsGateway` generates realistic files so the pipeline works without credentials), `Live` (Azure). Credentials `SpApi:ClientId/ClientSecret/RefreshToken` come from user-secrets or Key Vault only.
- This is a web-only SP-API client. Do not reference the WPF `AERai.Seller.SpApiClient` — the two apps stay independent (CI enforces it).

## Database: one centralized DB, five schemas

| Schema | Role |
|---|---|
| `stg` | Raw imports. `stg.ImportBatch` + one table per source (`OrderLine`, `InventoryRow`, `SettlementLine`). All business columns are `nvarchar`; every row is kept with its `RawLine` and an `ErrorMessage` after promotion. |
| `core` | Curated, typed, constrained tables (`Product`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `InventorySnapshot`, `Settlement`, `SettlementLine`). Written **only** by `core.usp_PromoteImportBatch` and the Products/COGS tool. |
| `rpt` | SQL views over `core` (`vw_DailySalesBySku`, `vw_OrderSummary`, `vw_InventoryPosition`, `vw_SettlementSummary`) mapped as EF keyless entities. Pages read these. |
| `ops` | Ingestion schedules, run history, and the ingested-report ledger. |
| `auth` | ASP.NET Core Identity tables. |

Flow: **upload → `stg` (raw) → promote proc (TRY_CONVERT + MERGE, idempotent) → `core` → `rpt` views → pages.** Views and the proc are created in migrations with `migrationBuilder.Sql` and must have matching `Down` SQL. When changing a view/proc, add a new migration that `CREATE OR ALTER`s it — never edit an applied migration.

Locally SQL Server and Azurite run in Docker (`docker compose up -d`). SQL Server uses the named volume `sql2025data` (fixed name, shared with the equivalent `docker run` command), so data survives container rebuilds.

Integration tests (`tests/AERai.Web.Infrastructure.Tests`) run only when `AERAI_TEST_SQL` (server connection string, no database) and/or `AERAI_TEST_BLOB` (e.g. `UseDevelopmentStorage=true`) are set; each test class creates and drops its own database / container. Without `AERAI_TEST_BLOB`, SQL tests use an in-memory raw store.

## Auth

ASP.NET Core Identity, cookie auth, no self-registration. Roles: `Admin` (users + everything), `Operator` (imports, promotion, Amazon sync schedules, COGS edits), `Viewer` (read-only). Every page requires login by default; `Account/Login` is the only anonymous page. `/Tools` requires Operator, `/Admin` requires Admin.

## Secrets & configuration

- Never commit secrets. Local: `web/.env` (gitignored, copied from `.env.example`) for Docker, `dotnet user-secrets` for the UI project.
- Connection string key: `ConnectionStrings:Sql`. Raw storage: `ConnectionStrings:RawStorage` (`UseDevelopmentStorage=true` for Azurite, set in `appsettings.Development.json`) or, in Azure, `RawStorage:ServiceUri` with managed identity (storage account has shared keys disabled). Dev admin seed: `Seed:AdminEmail` / `Seed:AdminPassword` (only seeded when both are set).
- Azure: Key Vault via managed identity (`KeyVault:Uri`), Azure SQL with Entra-only auth (managed identity, no SQL password).

## Commands

```bash
cp .env.example .env                      # then set MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD

dotnet build AERai.Web.slnx
dotnet test AERai.Web.slnx
dotnet run --project src/AERai.Web.UI     # Development auto-applies migrations + seeds roles/admin
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project src/AERai.Web.Infrastructure --startup-project src/AERai.Web.Infrastructure --output-dir Persistence/Migrations
