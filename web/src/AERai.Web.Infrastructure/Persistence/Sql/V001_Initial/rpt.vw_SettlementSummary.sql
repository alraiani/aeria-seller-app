  rpt.vw_SettlementSummary
  Purpose : Settlement payouts broken into sales, fees, refunds, and other, for the Settlements page.
  Grain   : One row per settlement (SettlementId).
  Sources : core.Settlement, core.SettlementLine.
  Notes   : Bucketing rules, in priority order:
              Refunds - transaction-type 'Refund' (all of its amounts, including refunded fees)
              Sales   - transaction-type 'Order' with amount-type 'ItemPrice'
              Fees    - amount-type 'ItemFees', or transaction-type 'ServiceFee'
              Other   - everything else (promotions, reimbursements, adjustments)
            Net is the sum of every line and equals the payout.
